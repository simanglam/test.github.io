# Learn LaTeX

      >LaTeX簡介</h3>
    <!--<p>LaTeX can be scary for new users as it is <em>not</em> a word processor, 
    and because it is not a single program. Our aim is to help you get 
    started with LaTeX from the basics, installation, to writing code, without 
    trying to show you <em>everything</em> in one go. <a href="./mission">More on our mission &hellip;</a></p>-->
    <p>對新接觸LaTeX的人來說LaTeX可以變得非常恐怖，因為第一他並<b>不是</b>一般的文書處理軟體，
    第二它並不是由單一軟體所組成的，我們的目標是幫助你從零開始學習LaTeX，同時避免接收到太多資訊。</p>

## Going further

We cover getting more information in [the last lesson](./lesson-16), but it is worth saying now that getting access to a book about LaTeX is still the best way to learn the details. We give some recommendations in the last lesson.
